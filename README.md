PROBLEM STATEMENT
The fast-fashion industry thrives on speed, adaptability, and creativity, yet it remains shackled by outdated workflows that hinder its ability to meet modern demands. Traditional design-to-production cycles span 3-5 months, with the design and sampling phase alone consuming 2-3 weeks. This sluggish pace clashes with the rapid evolution of fashion trends, driven by social media and influencer culture, where consumer preferences shift within days, not months. As a result, brands struggle to deliver fresh, trend-aligned designs quickly, leading to missed market opportunities and significant inefficiencies.
